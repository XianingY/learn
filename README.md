This repository is a personal learning workspace with multiple small projects across different tech stacks.

## Projects
- `go/vortex-gate`: lightweight ConnectRPC + Vanguard gateway service with an Echo API.
- `rust/mini-redis`: async Redis server implementation using Tokio.
- `rust/web-server`: REST-style web server with TODOs API.
- `rust/mini-lsm`: LSM-tree learning implementation (in progress).
- `nextjs`: Next.js app scaffolded with create-next-app.

Each subproject contains its own README with details on how to run it.
